A disk image is a compacted file containing information within a directory.

You make a disk image with cfdisk, creating space for it first. Then, you
transfer the files you want into the disk image, and then delete the images.

A disk partition is the space removed for a disk image to be made.

There is usually one, but you can make it have more.

It will reduce the total space and reduce preformance.

You have to change the space with cfdisk.
